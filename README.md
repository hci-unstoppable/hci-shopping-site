## Team Members

* Jakub Urbaniak: I am skilled at creating semantic HTML, following W3C guidelines,
  basic typography in CSS (primarily grid and flexbox), and some JavaScript.
  I am especially good in regards to finding fixes for JavaScript through research.

* Alex Pinto: I'd say that my biggest struggle is creating responsive CSS;
  calculating ems, etc., is a massive weak spot for me. I'm skilled at creating semantic HTML,
  and find trying to make things work in JavaScript to be one of the funner parts of this class.

* Sean Khuon: My biggest struggles are CSS and Javascript. I am decent at testing and writing reports.
  I hope to use my time with my group members to strengthen my skills in CSS and Javascript.
